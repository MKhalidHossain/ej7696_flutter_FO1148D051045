## Overview

**EJ Flutter App** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed with a clear MVC structure and modern Flutter development practices. It uses **Riverpod** to manage application state in a predictable and maintainable way, while **GoRouter** provides declarative routing and navigation flow management.

The application structure supports scalable feature development, API-driven screens, local persistence, theming, reusable widgets, and a clean controller-based business logic layer. It is suitable for production-oriented Flutter development and future project expansion.

---

## Architecture

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

- **Models** define the application's data structures and business entities.
- **Views** contain UI screens and reusable presentation widgets.
- **Controllers** manage business logic and state updates using Riverpod providers and notifiers.

### Architectural Highlights

- Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data
- Centralized route management with GoRouter
- Scalable folder structure for future feature growth
- Reusable utility, constant, and theme configuration
- Local persistence support with SharedPreferences
- Service layer support for API and storage operations

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure your environment is ready:

- Flutter SDK installed
- Dart SDK installed
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android emulator, iOS simulator, or physical device
- API base URL configured in the constants file

Check your Flutter setup:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure the API base URL

Update the API configuration in:

```text
lib/utils/app_constants.dart
```

Example:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-api-url.com';
```

### 3. Add assets

Place project assets in the proper folders:

```text
assets/images/
assets/icons/
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
flutter run
```

### 5. Build the app

```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

---

## Configuration

### API Base URL

Edit:

```text
lib/utils/app_constants.dart
```

### Custom Colors

Edit:

```text
lib/utils/app_colors.dart
```

### App Theme

Edit:

```text
lib/utils/app_theme.dart
```

These files allow you to customize branding, color palette, and light/dark theme behavior.

- [Download APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJsvq3pIk6L81fwBCSxZxe-3rcVtQfut/view?usp=sharing)

> Ensure installation from unknown sources is enabled on your Android device if required.

---

## Usage

### Adding a New Screen

1. Create the screen under `lib/views/`
2. Add the route in `lib/routes/app_router.dart`
3. Connect the screen to a controller if state handling is required

### Adding a New Model

1. Create the model in `lib/models/`
2. Add `fromJson` and `toJson` methods for serialization
3. Use the model inside services and controllers as needed

### Adding a New Service

1. Create a service in `lib/services/`
2. Centralize API or storage logic there
3. Call the service through your controller/provider layer

---

## State Management Example

```dart
// Watch state
final authState = ref.watch(authControllerProvider);

// Read controller
ref.read(authControllerProvider.notifier).login(email, password);
```

This pattern keeps business logic outside the UI layer and improves maintainability.

---

## Development Notes

- Keep controllers focused on state and business rules
- Keep views free from heavy logic
- Centralize API and storage logic inside services
- Reuse theme and constants from the `utils/` directory
- Organize new features without breaking the MVC structure
- Add loading, error, and empty states for all API-driven screens

---

## Included Screens

The project currently includes flows and screens such as:

- Splash screen
- Login screen
- Register screen
- Home screen
- Profile screen
- Resource browsing screens
- Exam session screens
- Review and result screens
- Performance dashboard
- Purchase and unlock dialogs
- History view

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand protected route handling
- Add more API-driven modules
- Improve offline persistence strategy
- Add unit and widget testing
- Extend reusable widget library
- Introduce feature-specific folders if the project grows further
